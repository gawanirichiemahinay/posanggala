                    often neglected by filipino people because they look at it as "normal" or something not valuable because posa dominates the streets
                    of the Philippines.<br>
                    <br>In the Philippines, there are cases of animal cruelty, including of harming the stray cats. Let's stop animal cruelty! <i>Hindi 'yan

                    Welcome to Posang Gala, a heartfelt initiative created by Richie Mahinay, a dedicated student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. Richie has always been surrounded by a loving family that shares a deep affection for cats. This lifelong passion for our feline friends inspired him to develop this website as a platform to celebrate and appreciate the unique lives of Philippine cats. At Posang Gala, we believe that every cat, whether a beloved pet or a stray, deserves recognition and care. Our mission is not only to showcase the beauty and charm of these animals but also to address the pressing issue of animal cruelty in our country. We aim to raise awareness and encourage kindness towards all creatures, especially those who are often overlooked.<br>
                    <br>Through engaging content, funny stories, and educational resources, Posang Gala seeks to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for the lives of stray animals. By highlighting their experiences and struggles, we hope to inspire our community to take action and support animal welfare initiatives. This website is also dedicated to Richieâ€™s beloved partner, who shares his passion for the joy that cats bring into our lives. Together, we aspire to create a space where everyone can connect with the warmth and playfulness of these amazing creatures.<br>
                    <br>Join us on this journey to celebrate, protect, and cherish the lives of Philippine cats. Together, we can make a difference!<br>
